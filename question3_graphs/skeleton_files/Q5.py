def get_cheapest_outgoing_supply_route(graph, wh):
    """
    Finds the cheapest outgoing supply route from a given warehouse.

    This function searches for all outgoing connections from the given warehouse

    Parameters:
    graph (dict): The supply chain graph represented as an adjacency map.
    wh (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the origin warehouse.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing (origin warehouse, destination warehouse) 
           representing the cheapest outgoing supply route.
    None: If the warehouse has no outgoing supply routes or does not exist in the graph.
